Typically, Python is regarded as the most well-known of all and certification is considered to be the new hype instead of formal education in recent time.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In last 6 years of kaggle surveys following trends are shown:\n",
    "* There are fluctuations in the recorded responses per year.\n",
    "* More than 50% of the Data Scientist fall in the age group pf 18-34 and each year this age range is consistently shrinking i.e, Data scientists are majorly young adults. However, elderly people are also in this filed but their progression rate is quite low as compared to the former group.\n",
    "* Data Science filed is highly gender imbalanced, playing with MALE monopoly in all these 6 years. However, in 2020 FEMALES has showed incredible surge and the only ones with upward trend so far. Which shows the effect of women-empowerment in STEM and other fields in last couple of years.\n",
    "*  Gender non-binary or partiipants identified as genders other than males and females are largely concentrated in age group 20-35.\n",
    "* USA was at the top in the initial days of Data Science (2017 + 2018) but suddenly India overpassed USA and took the huge leap and now its on the 1st place in the field of Data Science from consecutive 4 years with the youngest Data Scientist worldwide (18-21).\n",
    "* Coursera is the most popular learning platform among all specially by young adults and most certification has been done by the people from 25-29 age group from day 1 ( 2018 onwards ). Whereas Kaggle Courses also in the race of competing with the former platform. Universities has just initiated with the DS learning.\n",
    "* Young adults that are in DS have mostly Master’s degree or Bachelor’s degree. In recent times, people in college are showing more interest and professionals has shown a downward trend in last couple of years.\n",
    "* Most of the research has been done in the applied filed of DS rather than theoretical and young data scientists are not much interested in publishing papers. By far people from 40-60 years of age are in the limelight in terms of publishing.\n",
    "* Most of the data science comminuty has less than 3years of coding experience and it has been observed that in 2019 and onwards expert progrmmaers switched their filed towards DS.\n",
    "* Majority of young people aged < 30 are not using the ML cloud products such Amazon cloud S3 notebook and Azure cloud services.\n",
    "* Large percentage of kaggle users less than 40 years old are either using tabealue for data visulaizations or Power BI.\n",
    "* Pyhton popularity is not linked with any specific age group. However, My SQL is most popular database systems in all age groups.\n",
    "* Among all online cloud notebooks Amazon S3 is most popular.\n",
    "* Most kaggle users in all age groups are from small companies which have less than 1 year experience. SImilar trend is show in students class which are most young people.\n",
    "* Scikit learn and tensor flow are getting popularity among all age groups in last 3 years.\n",
    "* Data visulaizations in case of Python are completed with matplotlib.\n",
    "* Python is most popular language in all age groups.\n",
    "* As expected kaggle users are mostly using kaggle notebook followed by google colab notebooks.\n",
    "* Even 70+ years old ML practioners are using ML tensorboard and ML flow for ML model monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nutshell:\n",
    "As per our hypothesis, there are many facotrs that are age dependent and has changed significantly over the years. However, we can't say each and every bit in Data Science filed is connected to the mentioned two factors and hence could be more connected points that need further investigation."
